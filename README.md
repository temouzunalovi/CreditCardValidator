# CreditCardValidator
 Credit Card Validator in Java Overview The Credit Card Validator is a Java program designed to verify the validity of a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm. This algorithm is a widely used method for validating various identification numbers, including credit card numbers, by performing a series of mathematical checks.  Features Luhn Algorithm Implementation: The core logic of the validator is based on the Luhn algorithm, which ensures the integrity of the credit card number by applying a checksum formula. Simple User Interface: The program is straightforward to use with a main method that allows users to input a credit card number and receive a validation result. How It Works Input Handling: The program accepts a credit card number as a string input. Digit Traversal: Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), the program traverses each digit of the card number. Doubling Mechanism: Every second digit, starting from the right, is doubled. If the doubled value exceeds 9, 9 is subtracted from it. Summation: All digits, modified as necessary, are summed together. Validation Check: The total sum is checked to see if it is a multiple of 10. If it is, the credit card number is considered valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
